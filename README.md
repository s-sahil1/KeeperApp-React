This a a Keeper App(Notes app) made using react, XML and react hooks. There are three main components Note.jsx, CreateArea.jsx and App.jsx, App.jsx just display the final app. In CreateArea, I have created the title area and and content area, with a Add button, after writing in title and content, and clicking on Add button, using hooks, the value are passed to the main App page where its stored in another useState hook array, and from there the values are passed to the Note.jsx, which displays each note added using array Map function. Finally the Note.jsx has a delete button which passes get the value of the item when the item is clicked and using hooks and function, values are passed from Note to App and then with the help of Array map function, the particular note is deleted and then the rest of the notes are displayed
